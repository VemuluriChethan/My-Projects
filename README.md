## Projects Overview

### 1. To-Do App

- **Location**: `Projects/todo-app/`
- **Description**: A simple web-based To-Do List application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. The app features a clean interface, responsive design, and accessibility support.
- **Files**:
  - `index.html`: The main HTML file for the To-Do app.
  - `README.md`: Documentation for the To-Do app.

### 2. URL Guardian

- **Location**: `Projects/security-projects/url-guardian/`
- **Description**: A security-focused project that analyzes URLs for potential threats using machine learning techniques. It classifies URLs as benign or malicious based on various features.
- **Files**:
  - `app.py`: The main application file that runs the Flask web server.
  - `model.pkl`: A serialized machine learning model used for URL classification.
  - `requirements.txt`: A list of Python packages required to run the project.
  - `train.py`: A script for training the machine learning model.
  - `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
  - `models/`: Contains files related to the machine learning model.
    - `feature_names.txt`: A text file listing the feature names used in the model.
    - `label_encoder.pkl`: A serialized label encoder for transforming categorical labels.
    - `xgb_url_classifier.pkl`: The serialized XGBoost classifier model.
  - `reports/`: Contains output reports generated during model evaluation.
    - `classification_report.txt`: A text file with classification metrics.
  - `templates/`: Contains HTML templates used by the Flask application.
    - `index.html`: The main HTML file for the web interface.
  - `__pycache__/`: Contains compiled Python files (.pyc) for performance optimization.
